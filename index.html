<h4>Configuration Downloads</h4>
<p>Our system can automatically change its interface based on the target audience. Some example configurations:</p>
<pre><code><a href="http://xodb.xstractgroup.com/publish/xodb/lithology.xodb">Geologist Logger Configuration Example</a><br/><br/><a href="http://xodb.xstractgroup.com/publish/xodb/assets.xodb">Asset Manager (Maintenance) Example</a><br/><br/><a href="http://xodb.xstractgroup.com/publish/xodb/release.xodb">Reset Configuration</a></code></pre>
<p>If you'd like to share your configuration or validation rules with the world, please email us (<a href="#contact">see below</a>) using "Tools->Share Configuration".</p>

<h5>Feature video (How-to configure XODB for a specific user group in 5 minutes)</h5>
<p>We will be releasing some video tutorials over time. Below is a short video that describes how to setup XODB for a specific user group (like geologists looking at core out on the field).</p>
<pre><code><a href="http://youtu.be/7jhOflkiLtE">Configuring XODB for specific users (YouTube)</a> - Make sure to watch it in HD.</code></pre>

<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Our vision is to support better quality of information in the mining industry. We'd like to provide an open standard and usable applications for companies to communicate data in a standard way, requiring less integration costs, and reducing the complexity and disparity between geological information. We have incorporated standards like CoalLog, the British Geological Survey's OpenGeoscience and CSIRO's AuScope systems into a comprehensive open source (free to use) database which we hope will benefit professionals and organisations alike. </p>

<h5>Open Source</h5>
<p>Open source technology gives you security over your own data. It's free to use and change. Open source encourages collaboration, not isolation. We intend to build a life of mine information system collaboratively with engagement from our clients, our peers, and the mining community.</p>

<h5>Remote Synchronisation with the Cloud</h5>
<p>Sharing data between geologists in the field, or between offices could not be easier. XODB supports the Microsoft cloud offering 'Azure'. If you'd like to take advantage of this feature, please <a href="#contact">contact us (see below)</a>.</p>
<div id="cloudsync" class="cloudsync"></div>

<h5>Storage &amp; Compliance</h5>
<p>The data you enter should sit in an enterprise grade database. We use Microsoft SQL Server as the basis to store your data (but the system will work with Oracle, Postgres etc.). By using a standards based database instead of spreadsheets, you can ensure that your data integrity is compliant with government and organisational standards. We can help you configure the system with versioning to ensure archival &amp; regulatory compliance. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) will allow your other applications and investments access the database.</p>

<h5>Reporting</h5>
<p>Your data belongs to you. The system provides a number of reporting options out-of-the-box including a native reporting application, and connections for Microsoft PowerView, Microsoft Excel PowerPivot and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services. As the product develops, we hope to share and develop a library of reporting templates with the community. Develop your own or start using publicly available reports!</p>

<h5>Coding Systems &amp; Nomenclature</h5>
<p>The first release of XODB will support CoalLog. It is possible to configure XODB to use your own nomenclature systems in place. As we collaborate on other commodity based nomenclature systems, we will add them to XODB for people to use.</p>

<h5>Open Data</h5>
<p>Integrate with other systems, tools and processes. You are free to change XODB the way you want, and access your data the way you want. We recommend that you adhere or collaborate with developing standards. So if you feel like something should change, share it!</p>

<h5>Future Proof</h5>
<p>XODB already has versioning, workflow, and spatial (WGS84) support built into the database. We intend to distribute these in the application as they are further developed. We're already using spatial information in our internal and client specific projects.</p>

<h5>Commercial Support Available</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.xstractgroup.com">Xstract</a> can provide commercial support for XODB. If you'd like help using XODB, or leverage the system in other ways not provided in the public version please <a href="#contact">contact us (see below)</a>.</p>

<h4>User Help</h4>
<p>We have an area for documentation which we envisage to be comprehensive over time. If you'd like to provide feedback, or contribute to the docs please <a href="#contact">let us know</a>.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>The mining industry has traditionally avoided standard methods of logging and nomenclature due to the complexity of the environment, disparity between projects, geologists, engineers, operations staff and location. Yet, at the end of the day, despite these differences, a consistent approach for exploration, geology and mining is necessary to communicate to mine stakeholders and underpins the very resource estimates that make mines viable. Standardisation is not a new idea. Classification systems have existed for more than 200 years, but through the internet - we hope we can provide a democratised standard - which is accessible, easy to use and adapt. We are developing the standard such that we can now communicate with our clients irrespective of technology, and build intelligent systems to help our consultants spend more time on decision making, and less on data management. Xstract will provide the industry support services around XODB, its customisation and integration with other tools. At present, Xstract is also developing an offline and online synchronisation capability for XODB, and will be able to provide this functionality soon to interested clients. If you are interested in collaborating with us or exploring how it might help you or your team please <a href="#contact">give us a call</a>. </p>

<h4>Roadmap</h4>

<p>There are still a number of things we are working on, and are actively seeking clients and contributors to invest their time and resources in helping expand the solution. For more information on <a href="https://github.com/Xstract/xodb/wiki/XODB-Progress">XODB progress, please see our more detailed roadmap.</a></p>

<p>We are actively looking for people to contribute their nomenclatures to a commodity agnostic standard. Coal has been contributed via the efforts of CoalLog. We are looking to develop other coding systems by commodity in a similar way.</p>

<p>We hope to become the defacto standard for storing end-to-end mining information covering: reconciliation; exploration; advanced exploration; mine development; mine implementation; mine operations and mine closure.</p>
