        <h3>Welcome to Xstract Mining Consultants GitHub repository.</h3>

<p>This is where you can stay up to date with Xstract's open source applications, implementations, and code updates.</p>

<h3>XODB Released!</h3>

<p>Xstract's Open Database (for exploration,geology and mining) has been released. Please follow the download link below to get your copy:</p>

<pre><code><a href="http://xodb.xstractgroup.com/publish/xodb/0/XODB.Win.application">Download the XODB application.</a>
</code></pre>
<p>We will soon be releasing a data migration tool for users of other systems, but if you'd like help with importing data in the meantime, please contact us (see below).</p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Our vision is to support better quality of information in the mining industry. We'd like to provide an open standard and usable application for companies to communicate data in a standard way, requiring less integration costs, and reducing the complexity and disparity between geological information. We have incorporated standards like AusIMM's CoalLog, the British Geological Survey's OpenGeoscience and CSIRO's AuScope systems into a comprehensive open source (free to use) database which we hope will benefit professionals and organisations alike. </p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<h5>Open Source</h5>
<p>Open source technology gives you security over your own data. It's free to use and change. Open source encourages collaboration, not isolation. We intend to build a life of mine information system collaboratively with engagement from our clients, our peers, and the mining community.</p>

<h5>Remote Synchronisation with the Cloud</h5>
<p>Sharing data between geologists in the field, or between offices could not be easier. XODB supports the Microsoft cloud offering 'Azure'. If you'd like to take advantage of this feature, please contact us (see below).</p>
<div id="cloudsync" class="cloudsync"></div>

<h5>Storage &amp; Compliance</h5>
<p>The data you enter should sit in an enterprise grade database. We recommend using Microsoft SQL Server to store your data (but the system will work with others). By using a standards based database instead of spreadsheets, you can ensure that your data integrity is compliant with government and organisational standards. We can help you configure the system with versioning to ensure archival &amp; regulatory compliance. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) will allow your other applications and investments access the database.</p>

<h5>Reporting</h5>
<p>Your data belongs to you. The system provides a number of reporting options out-of-the-box including a native reporting application, and connections for Microsoft PowerView, Microsoft Excel PowerPivot and Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services. As the product develops, we hope to share and develop a library of reporting templates with the community. Develop your own or start using publicly available reports!</p>

<h5>Coding Systems &amp; Nomenclature</h5>
<p>The first release of XODB will support CoalLog. It is possible to configure XODB to use your own nomenclature systems in place. As we collaborate on other commodity based nomenclature systems, we will add them to XODB for people to use.</p>

<h5>Open Data</h5>
<p>Integrate with other systems, tools and processes. You are free to change XODB the way you want, and access your data the way you want. We recommend that you adhere or collaborate with developing standards. So if you feel like something should change, share it!</p>

<h5>Future Proof</h5>
<p>XODB already has versioning, workflow, and spatial (WGS84) support built into the database. We intend to distribute these in the application as they are developed.</p>

<h5>Commecial Support Available</h5>
<p><a href="http://xstractgroup.com">Xstract</a> can provide commercial support for XODB. If you'd like help using XODB, or leverage the system in other ways not provided in the public version please contact us (see below).</p>


<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Geology has traditionally avoided standard methods of logging and nomenclature due to the complexity of the environment, disparity between projects, geologists and locations. Yet, at the end of the day, despite these differences, a consistent approach for modelling the underground environment is necessary to communicate to mine stakeholders and underpins the very resource estimates that make mines viable. Standardisation is not a new idea. Classification systems have existed for more than 200 years, but through the internet - we hope we can provide a democratised standard - which is accessible, easy to use and adapt. We are developing the standard such that we can now communicate with our clients irrespective of technology, and build intelligent systems to help our consultants spend more time on decision making, and less on data management. Xstract will provide the industry support services around XODB, its customisation and integration with other tools. At present, Xstract is also developing an offline and online synchronisation capability for XODB, and will be able to provide this functionality soon to interested clients. If you are interested in collaborating with us or exploring how it might help you or your team please give us a call. </p>

<h4>Roadmap</h4>

<p>There are still a number of things we are working on, and are actively seeking clients and contributors to invest their time and resources in helping expand the solution. Currently we are working on an importation tool to help with data migration from other systems, a record and document management system, spatial reports, depth-correction, OLAP &amp; OData reporting and a web-based version.</p>

<p>We are actively looking for people to contribute their nomenclatures to a commodity based standard. Coal has been contributed via the efforts of ACARP and CoalLog. We are looking to develop other coding systems by commodity in a similar way.</p>

<p>We hope to become the defacto standard for storing end-to-end mining information covering: exploration; advanced exploration; mine development; mine implementation; mine operations and mine closure.</p>
